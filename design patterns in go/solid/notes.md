# SOLID Principles and Examples

1. Single Responsibility Principle
2. Open-Closed Principle
3. Liskov Substitution Principle
4. Interface Segregation Principle
5. Dependency Inversion Principle

## Single Responsibility Principle

- A type should only have one reason to change
- **Separation of Concerns** - different types/packages handling different, independent tasks/problems

## Open-Closed Principle

- Types should be open for extension but closed for modification

## Liskov Substitution Principle

- You should be able to substitude an embedding type in place of its embedded part

## Interface Segregation Principle

- Don't put too much into an interface; split into separate interfaces
- YAGNI - You Ain't Going To Need It

## Dependency Inversion Principle

- High-level modules should not depend upon low-level ones, use abstractions
