# Go

A repository to contain all my Go studies.

- [x] 1. Understand the basics of Go, achieved by completing the `Go: The Complete Developer's Guide`.
- [x] 2. "Get in the reps" - build the muscle memory of typing Go code by doing a Go code-heavy course to build the muscle memory and familiarity of writing Go code. Achieved this by completing the `Design Patterns in Go`.
- [ ] 3. Learn how to build full applications. Achieving this by completing `Working with Microservices in Go (GoLang)`.
- [ ] 4. Create own applications
